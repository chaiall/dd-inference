FOR USERS: Bayes Net Inference Interface

o To run the text interface to the system **from the 'prob' directory**:

    UNIX:    Type 'run prob.PShell' from 'prob' directory.
    WINDOWS: Type 'CMD /C run.bat prob.PShell' from 'prob' directory.

    Type 'help' from within the shell for information on commands.
                           
o Sample Bayes Nets in bn/ex/ directory:

    Alarm_JB.bif     MedNoisyMax.bif  Munin4.bif      Water.bif
    Barley.bif       Mildew.bif       NoisyMax15.bif  alarm.bif
    BigNoisyMax.bif  Munin1.bif       NoisyOr15.bif   carpo.bif
    Diabetes.bif     Munin2.bif       Pigs.bif        hailfinder.bif
    Link.bif         Munin3.bif       Test.bif        insurance.bif

  (Most of these are borrowed from public online repositories.)

o The easiest way to familiarize yourself with how to load the Bayes Net
  and query it is to look at and run the example scripts.  To run
  these scripts type 'exec script-name' from within PSHell, or specify
  them when PSHell is invoked:

   o alarm_test.psh   
   o big_noisy_max.psh  
   o test.psh
   o barley_test.psh  
   o med_noisy_max.psh

o For the tabular CPT representation one can set the DD_TYPE 
  environmental variable to TABLE (enumerated tabular representation),
  ADD (algebraic decision diagram), or AADD (affine ADD).  See
  'alarm_test.psh' to see how DD_TYPE is specified.

  For queries that involve context-specific independence, ADDs and
  AADDs work well.  For queries that involve additive and multiplicative
  independence (e.g., discretized linear functions, noisy-or), AADDs
  work the best but can exhibit numerical precision issues for large
  factors that occur during inference.

o Quick overview of main software components:

    PShell.java  - Handles the main command line interface,
                   see this code to understand how Bayes
                   Nets are loaded and queries are specified
                   and executed.

    bn/BN.java   - Handles main Bayes net operations.
